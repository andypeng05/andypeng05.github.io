Hi! I'm Andy, an undergrad Researcher and Engineer at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu) studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). 

My research interests lie in building efficient and intelligent AI agents using Reinforcement Learning and interacting with the world through Robotics.
Currently, I'm working on offline-to-online RL at [BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu) under the [RAIL](https://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu) group. Outside my research, I enjoy building applied machine learning applications within the wonderful community at [Launchpad](https://launchpad.studentorg.berkeley.edu).

I've also been exploring hardware design/validation and FPGA programming with the Energy Infrastructure team at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com), and learned PCB design and firmware alongside my friends at [Berkeley Formula Racing](https://fsae.studentorg.berkeley.edu).

When I'm not in the lab or garage, I spend my time creating art with my oil paints and colored pencils, playing intramural basketball, and searching for new matcha lattes in the bay!

If you'd like to chat, please reach out at [andypeng at berkeley dot edu].

- I just released my first ever research paper with BAIR! We explore how to do RL fine-tuning without offline data retention. I'm excited to see how [Warm-start RL (WSRL)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07762) can help scale up RL for real-world tasks, and the future of efficient RL finetuning. (Update: WSRL has been accepted to ICLR 2025!)

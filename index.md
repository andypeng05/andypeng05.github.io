Hi! I'm Andy, an undergraduate Researcher and Engineer at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu) studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). 

My research interests lie in building efficient and generalizable AI using Reinforcement Learning and interacting with the world through Robotics.
Currently, I'm working on offline-to-online RL at [Berkeley Artifical Intelligence Research](https://bair.berkeley.edu), advised by professor [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/). Outside my research, I enjoy building applied machine learning applications with my friends at [Launchpad](https://launchpad.studentorg.berkeley.edu).
I'll also be working on LLM training and infrastructure at [NVIDIA](https://nvidia.com) this summer.

If you'd like to chat, please reach out at [andypeng at berkeley dot edu].

## Recent News
last updated: July 2025

- We released some exciting real world RL results with WSRL on a Franka robot! Check it out on the [website](https://zhouzypaul.github.io/wsrl/)
- I just released my first research paper with BAIR! We explore how to do RL fine-tuning without offline data retention. I'm excited to see how [Warm-start RL (WSRL)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07762) can help scale up RL for real-world tasks, and the future of efficient RL finetuning. (Update: WSRL has been accepted to ICLR 2025!)
